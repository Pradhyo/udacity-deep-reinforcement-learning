# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Projects

These are my projects from [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)

[Here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning) is Udacity's repository for this nanodegree and these projects.

#### Downloading project files

Downloaded the project files from each project workspace on Udacity by zipping it first `tar -czvf project-folder.tar.gz project-folder` and then downloading the compressed file from the UI.
